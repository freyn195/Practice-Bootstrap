         <h4>Good Songs</h4>
         <p>Yeah, this album is dedicated
          To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
          To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
          Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
          And all the niggas in the struggle You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
          It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
          Hangin' pictures on my wall  Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
          I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped  Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
          Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack With the hat to match
          Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
          Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
          Born sinner, the opposite of a winner Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
          Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri  Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
          I'm blowin' up like you thought I would  Call the crib, same number, same hood
          It's all good (It's all good)    And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
          You know very well Who you are     Don't let 'em hold you down
          Reach for the stars  You had a goal   But not that many
          'Cause you're the only one  I'll give you good and plenty
          I made the change from a common thief To up close and personal with Robin Leach
          And I'm far from cheap I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
          Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
          Girls used to diss me  Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
          I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
          Now honeys play me close like butter play toast  From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
          Condos in Queens, indo for weeks  Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
          Livin' life without fear Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
          Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
          Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
          Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
          And it's still all good
          And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
          You know very well
          Who you are
          Don't let 'em hold you down
          Reach for the stars
          You had a goal
          But not that many
          'Cause you're the only one
          I'll give you good and plenty
          Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
          When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
          50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
          Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
          Phone bill about two G's flat
          No need to worry, my accountant handles that
          And my whole crew is loungin'
          Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
          Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
          Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
          And she loves to show me off of course
          Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
          We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
          No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
          Birthdays was the worst days
          Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
          Uh, damn right, I like the life I live
          'Cause I went from negative to positive
          And it's all (It's all good, nigga)
          And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
          You know very well
          Who you are
          Don't let 'em hold you down
          And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
          Reach for the stars
          You had a goal
          But not that many
          'Cause you're the only one
          And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
          I'll give you good and plenty
          Representin' B-Town in the house
          Junior Mafia, mad flavor
          Uh, uh, yeah, aight
          You know very well
          Who you are
          Don't let 'em hold you down
          Reach for the stars
          You had a goal
          But not that many
          'Cause you're the only one
          I'll give you good and plenty
          Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
          Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
          Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
          It's all good
          That's right, '94
          And on and on, and on and on
          You know very well
          Who you are
          Don't let 'em hold you down
          Reach for the stars</p>
          <br>
         <p>I never meant to cause you any sorrow
          I never meant to cause you any pain
          I only wanted one time to see you laughing
          I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          I only wanted to see you bathing in the purple rain
          I never wanted to be your weekend lover
          I only wanted to be some kind of friend,
          Hey Baby, I could never steal you from another
          It's such a shame our friendship had to end
          Purple rain, purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain
          Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changin'
          It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too
          You say you want a leader, but you can't seem to make up your mind
          And I think you better close it and let me guide you to the purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          Purple rain, purple rain
          If you know what I'm singin' about up here,
          Come on raise your hand
          Purple rain, purple rain
          I only want to see you, only want to see in the purple rain</p>
